### User Data on the Blockchain

    Data is always protected by encryption, whether it is being transmitted or stored.
    Data is stored in decentralized vaults. This makes it more difficult for hackers to steal or damage the data.
    Every time data is shared, a record of the transaction is kept. This helps to track who has access to the data and when it was accessed.
    Data can be shared directly with partners using keys. This means that partners do not need to have access to the encryption keys, which further protects the data.

### Record of Consent

    Data is stored on a blockchain in immutable ways. This means that users can be confident that their data is secure and private.
    Users have the option to opt in to sharing their data with third parties. They can also specify their privacy preferences, such as which data they are willing to share and with whom.
    Smart contracts are used to enforce regulations and preferences when data is shared with third parties. This helps to ensure that consumers' data is protected, even if the third party is not trustworthy.
